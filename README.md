# kahlilwassell.github.io
This is my portfolio site hosted on GitHub Pages. It provides more detailed information about me and also serves as a personal project to grow my web development skills.

## Run locally
This is a static site, so you can open it directly or serve it with a simple local server.

Option 1: Open the file directly
1. Open `index.html` in your browser.

Option 2: Run a local server (recommended)
1. From the repo root, run:
   - `python3 -m http.server 8000`
2. Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Deploy
This repo is configured for GitHub Pages. Push to your default branch and GitHub Pages will serve the site.
